We’re solution engineers with Microsoft’s National Security Group. We spend our days partnering with government customers to help them build amazing things with Azure, GitHub, the full Microsoft stack, and the open source technologies that power today’s modern applications. From early whiteboard sessions to production deployments, we work side by side with teams to turn big ideas into secure, scalable solutions that support real-world missions.

Whether it’s modernizing legacy applications, wrangling AI services, standing up secure infrastructure, or diving deep into DevSecOps pipelines, we’re all about solving real problems in practical ways. We care about performance, compliance, and getting the details right, but we also care about making technology approachable and usable for the people who rely on it every day.
